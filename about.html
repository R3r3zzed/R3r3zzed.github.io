      <p>Hey! I'm Sedat, a Junior specializing in cybersecurity, software engineering, and data science
         at California State University, East Bay. 
         I'm always looking for an exciting challenge and learning experience within 
         cybersecurity and software engineering. I'm skilled in Data Structures, IT essentials, design patterns, and several
         programming languages.</p>
      <p>Through my various studies and hands-on experience in cybersecurity and SE, I've advanced my abilities in 
        the Raspberry Pi and Rubber Ducky projects, and I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to the advancement of cybersecurity,
        especially in the Air Force. 
        During my free time, I like to workout, hike, play some good games, or read a good book. As of now,
      Meditations is my current read.</p>
      <p>I believe that a calm mindset, honesty, and an emotional balance are essential to
        reach one's peak. Through these beliefs, I was able to win Warrior Spirit at UC Berkeley's 
        Air Force ROTC, Dean's List in my previous semester, and an overall good standing with my
        peers and supervisors.
         If you're looking for a passionate and dedicated individual for cybersecurity and SE, let's get in touch!</p>
