      <h2>ROTC Experience</h2>
      <img src="images/ROTC Group.jpg" alt="ROTC" class="responsive-image">
      <p>As a third-year cadet in UC Berkeley's Air Force ROTC program, I've rapidly advanced through various leadership positions within my flight, notably serving as the Flight Commander. Beyond my immediate responsibilities, I am actively involved with the Arnold Air Society, an honorary, professional, and service-oriented organization. 
        In my role as an Active Training Officer, I've been instrumental in designing and delivering projects and seminars with my three person team. 
        These initiatives are tailored to provide Active members of our squadron with diverse perspectives and methodologies, enhancing their leadership capabilities and strategic thinking.
        Notably, my commitment to excellence and leadership development has positioned me in the top third of cadets in my year. 
        This ranking is a testament to my dedication to both my personal growth and the mentorship of my peers, underscoring my potential as a future leader in the Air Force. </p>

      <h2>Muslim Student Association</h2>
      <p>During my two-year tenure as the Trusted Consultant for my previous university's Muslim Student Association, I played a pivotal role in enriching the campus community through a variety of initiatives.
         My contributions ranged from conceptualizing and organizing both online and in-person events, such as religious seminars and collaborative Ramadan dinners with other cultural groups on campus. 
         These events not only fostered a sense of unity and understanding among students but also highlighted the vibrancy of our cultural heritage.
         Additionally, I was instrumental in advocating for the Muslim student body's needs, notably assisting in the successful negotiation for a dedicated Muslim prayer room within the newly planned university Student Center.
          This achievement was a significant milestone, ensuring that future generations of students would have a space for spiritual reflection and practice, thereby enhancing the inclusivity and diversity of our university community.

      <h2>Filipino American Student Association</h2>
      <img src="images/FASA Group.jpg" alt="FASA" class="responsive-image">
      <p>During my time with the Filipino American Student Association, I had the privilege of serving in two distinct roles across different semesters, contributing significantly to our community's vibrancy and success.
        In my first term as Cultural Chair, I was responsible for meticulously curating the various suites for that year's Pilipino Cultural Night, a night where a story and dances revolving around that year's theme would be showcased to the public. 
        This involved an in-depth exploration of the regions represented, ensuring that each suite not only showcased captivating dances but also conveyed the rich history and cultural significance behind them.
         My efforts aimed to create an immersive and educational experience that celebrated our heritage and educated our audience.
         Transitioning to the role of Fundraiser Chair in my second term, I embarked on a strategic mission to secure financial support for our association. 
         This entailed negotiating with local businesses to host fundraisers, allowing us a share of the profits. 
         These initiatives not only bolstered our financial resources but also strengthened our presence and engagement within the community. 
         Furthermore, I took on the critical task of finding a venue for our winter ball and selecting a caterer that aligned with our event's theme and budget. 
        My dedication to these roles ensured the successful execution of our events, contributing to the enrichment of our association and the broader university community.
