        <h3>Boggle Game Project</h3>
        <p>Initiating a challenging yet enriching journey, I developed a Boggle Board Solver as part of a school project. 
          This endeavor leveraged C++ to create a solver for the classic Boggle game, where the objective is to discover words within a grid of letters. 
          Employing advanced programming concepts such as recursion and a prefix tree (Trie), the solver excels at identifying valid words through an optimized path-finding approach.
          A notable achievement of this project was the enhancement of the parsing speed, enabling the processing of over 100,000 words in just 23 milliseconds. 
          This accomplishment was achieved by refining data processing techniques, showcasing the solver's efficiency and my adeptness in algorithm optimization.
          Although initiated as an academic requirement, this project profoundly deepened my understanding of advanced data structures and algorithms. 
          It stands as a testament to my dedication to solving complex problems and crafting innovative solutions.</p>

        <h3>Raspberry Pi Ethical Hacking tool</h3>
        <p>I'm embarking on an exciting venture into cybersecurity, utilizing a Raspberry Pi as a foundational tool for ethical hacking practices. This project is not only about mastering network security and penetration testing 
          techniques but also extends into the realm of application development. I'm in the process of creating an app tailored 
          for the Raspberry Pi environment, with plans to rigorously test it on an Android emulator before deploying it to actual Android devices. This initiative 
          combines technical prowess with creative problem-solving, aiming to enhance security protocols. Stay tuned to my website, where I
           chronicle the development process and share insights from this multifaceted journey in cybersecurity.</p>

        <h3>Tron</h3>
        <p>Launching into an innovative journey, I'm developing Tron, an AI-driven personal assistant inspired by the iconic JARVIS. 
          This endeavor, currently in its initial planning phase, seeks to integrate daily news, weather forecasts, 
          traffic updates, and personal schedule management into a unified conversational interface. At its core, Tron will be powered by Rasa, chosen for its advanced capabilities in creating sophisticated AI interactions. 
          While the full development cycle has yet to begin, the roadmap includes leveraging various APIs for real-time information and enhancing the assistant through comprehensive testing. As Tron evolves from a concept into reality, 
          stay tuned to my website for regular updates and insights into this venture, combining AI with the essence of daily convenience.</p>
