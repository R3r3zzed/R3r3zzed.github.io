      <h1>Semgrep in CI/CD: Developer-Friendly Security with Room to Grow</h1>
      <p><strong>By Sedat Altun</strong></p>

      <p>During my internship with <strong>IT Society</strong>, I had the opportunity to work with <a href="https://semgrep.dev" target="_blank">Semgrep</a>, an open-source static analysis tool. My assignment was to integrate it into our GitHub-based CI/CD pipeline, and in doing so, I got a front-row seat to how modern DevSecOps workflows are evolving‚Äîand how security tools are trying to catch up.</p>

      <h2>üîç What Makes Semgrep Special?</h2>
      <p>Semgrep‚Äôs strength is in its simplicity. It scans source code for vulnerabilities and bad practices with speed and precision. But beyond that, what struck me most was how naturally it fits into a developer‚Äôs workflow.</p>

      <p>You don‚Äôt need to learn a whole new ecosystem. You don‚Äôt need to write complex rules (though you can). You just drop it into a GitHub Action or run it locally, and it starts doing its job‚Äîquietly, effectively, and without breaking your rhythm.</p>

      <h2>‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Integration Walkthrough</h2>
      <p>We used GitHub Actions to run Semgrep automatically on every push and pull request. Here‚Äôs the configuration we used:</p>
      <pre><code>
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  semgrep:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: returntocorp/semgrep-action@v1
        with:
          config: auto
      </code></pre>
      <p>Within seconds, developers would see inline comments and checks right in the pull request. That kind of feedback loop is powerful‚Äîit encourages security-aware development without slowing people down.</p>

      <h2>üì∑ Real Example: Detecting a NoSQL Injection Risk</h2>
      <img src="../images/semgrep-results.png" alt="Semgrep NoSQL Injection Finding" class="responsive-image">
      <p>This screenshot shows Semgrep flagging a critical vulnerability in a test repository. It detected a potential NoSQL injection vector‚Äîsomething that could easily be missed during normal reviews.</p>

      <h2>üõ°Ô∏è Additional Security Checks</h2>
      <p>Semgrep also surfaces additional security issues beyond code bugs, like unsafe Dockerfile configurations and XSS vulnerabilities in templates:</p>

      <img src="../images/missing-user.png" alt="Semgrep finding: Missing USER in Dockerfile" class="responsive-image">
      <p>This finding highlights a high-severity risk in a Dockerfile where no non-root user was specified. Running containers as <code>root</code> introduces unnecessary risk, especially in shared environments.</p>

      <img src="../images/autoescape-disabled.png" alt="Semgrep finding: autoescape-disabled (XSS risk)" class="responsive-image">
      <p>This alert shows how Semgrep caught a medium-severity XSS risk due to HTML escaping being disabled. Even a small template change like <code>escape=false</code> can open the door to cross-site scripting when user data gets involved.</p>

      <h2>üí¨ My Thoughts: The Good, the Gaps, and the Gray Area</h2>
      <p>Semgrep's true strength lies in its ability to scale‚Äîfrom individual developers to enterprise-level organizations like Lyft, who have adopted Semgrep for security at scale. With its flexibility, speed, and support for custom rules, Semgrep offers an enterprise-ready DevSecOps solution that rivals more traditional security tools. Whether you're an individual developer, a growing team, or a large company with complex security needs, Semgrep can seamlessly fit and grow with you.</p>

      <h2>üéì What I Took Away</h2>
      <p>This experience gave me more than just exposure to a tool‚Äîit helped me internalize what it means to ‚Äúshift left‚Äù in security. I realized that good security doesn't have to be heavy-handed. It can be as simple as giving developers real-time feedback in the environment they're already working in.</p>

      <p>Semgrep helped me appreciate the balance between speed and safety‚Äîand showed me that if security is baked into the dev flow, it doesn‚Äôt slow you down. It makes you faster.</p>
